## Sample Problem

### Handling Mixed-but-Related Types

- We have
    - Circle, Rectangle, and Square classes
- We want to be able to
    - Call getArea on an instance of any of three, even if we do not know which of the three types it is
    - Make an array of mixed shapes and calculate the sum of the areas
    - Make this array-summing method flexible enough to handle future types of shapes (Triangle, Ellipse, etc.)

---

### Attempt 1 Failure

- Implement each shape independently
    - Give each of Circle, Rectangle, and Square a getArea method
- Make Object[] containing mixed instances
    - Pass this to ShapeUtils.sumAreas
- In sumAreas, define parameter as Object[]
    - Then loop down, call getArea on each, add up result
    
---

### Attempt 1: Shapes

- Circle

```
public class Circle {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Rectangle

```
public class Rectangle {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Square

```
public class Square extends Rectangle {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

---

### Attempt 1: Desired Testing Code

```
public class ShapeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object[] shapes = { new Circle(10),
        new Rectangle(5, 10),
        new Square(10) };
        System.out.println("Sum of areas: " +
        ShapeUtils.sumAreas(shapes));
    }
}
```

---

### Attempt 1: Utility Class

```
public class ShapeUtils {
    public static double sumAreas(Object[] shapes) {
        double sum = 0;
        for(Object s: shapes) {
            sum = sum + s.getArea();
        }
        return(sum);
    }
    ...
}
```

This will not even compile! Why not?

---

### Attempt 2 (Reasonable but Imperfect)

- Make a class called Shape
    - Define a getArea method that always returns -1
        - Since no real shape can have a negative area, you will notice if you call getArea and get back a negative number
- Have all shapes extend this base class
    - Circle, Rectangle, and Square directly or indirectly extend Shape
        - Each provide a more specific definition of getArea
- Make Shape[] containing mixed instances
    - Pass this to ShapeUtils.sumAreas
- In sumAreas, define parameter as Shape[]
    - Then loop down, call getArea on each, add up result
    
---

### Attempt 2: Base Class

```
public class Shape {
    public double getArea() {
        return(-1);
    }
}
```

---

### Attempt 2: Shapes

- Circle

```
public class Circle extends Shape {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Rectangle

```
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Square

```
public class Square extends Rectangle {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

---

### Attempt 2: Utility Class

```
public class ShapeUtils {
    public static double sumAreas(Shape[] shapes) {
        double sum = 0;
        for(Shape s: shapes) {
            sum = sum + s.getArea();
        }
        return(sum);
    }
    ...
}
```

It is somewhat conventional to call this class Shapes instead of ShapeUtils.
However, that name is a bit confusing to beginners. 

---

### Attempt 2: Testing Code

```
public class ShapeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] shapes = { new Circle(10),
                            new Rectangle(5, 10),
                            new Square(10) };
        System.out.println("Sum of areas: " + ShapeUtils.sumAreas(shapes));
    }
}
```

A good try, especially for someone new to OOP. But, although it
works, it does have two deficiencies. What are they?

---

## Abstract Classes

- Idea
    - A class that you cannot directly instantiate (i.e., on which you cannot use “new”)
    - But you can subclass it and instantiate the subclasses
    - Methods marked abstract in parent class must be implemented by all child classes (unless they are also abstract)
- Syntax

```
public abstract class SomeClass {
    private SomeType instanceVar;
    public abstract SomeType abstractMethod(…);
    public SomeType concreteMethod(…) { … }
}
```

---

- Enforces behavior
    - Guarantees that all subclasses will have certain methods
    - Allows you handle collections of mixed-but-related types
    - Makes sure that your method on the mixed types will still work in the future when new types are defined
- Note
    – Although abstract classes were widely used through Java 7, they are less used in 
      Java 8. This is because new features were added to interfaces (next section) in Java 8,
      so now interfaces can do almost everything abstract classes can do, except for having 
      mutable (modifiable) instance variables. And, interfaces have advantages 
      that abstract classes lack. Abstract classes are still used, but interfaces more so. 
    – Conclusion: look briefly at the upcoming example to see the basic idea, but concentrate more on interfaces in the 
      next section.

---

### Attempt 3 (Good)

- Make an abstract class called Shape
    - Define the specification for a getArea method
- Have all shapes extend this base class
    - Circle, Rectangle, and Square directly or indirectly extend Shape
        - Each provide a definition of getArea
- Make Shape[] containing mixed instances
    - Pass this to ShapeUtils.sumAreas
- In sumAreas, define parameter as Shape[]
    - Then loop down, call getArea on each, add up result
    
---

### Attempt 3: Base class

```
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double getArea();
}
```

---

### Attempt 3: Shapes

- Circle

```
public class Circle extends Shape {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Rectangle

```
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Square

```
public class Square extends Rectangle {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

---

### Attempt 3: Utility Class

```
public class ShapeUtils {
    public static double sumAreas(Shape[] shapes) {
        double sum = 0;
        
        for(Shape s: shapes) {
            sum = sum + s.getArea();
        }
        
        return(sum);
    }
    ...
}
```

---

### Attempt 3: Testing Code

```
public class ShapeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] shapes = { new Circle(10),
                            new Rectangle(5, 10),
                            new Square(10) };
        System.out.println("Sum of areas: " + ShapeUtils.sumAreas(shapes));
    }
}
```

A very good solution, and this illustrates the general benefit of abstract classes. 
However, in this specific case, Shape has no instance variables, so an interface is slightly more flexible than an abstract class.

---

## Interfaces

- Idea
    - A model for a class. Usually like an abstract class but without any concrete methods or instance variables
        - However, Java 8 interfaces can have concrete (default) methods and also static methods. This is covered in later section on Java 8 interfaces.
- Syntax

```
    public interface Interface1 {
        SomeType method1(…);
    }
    public interface Interface2 {
        SomeType method2(…);
    }
    public class SomeClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
        // Real definitions of method1 and method 2
    }
```

---

- Enforces behavior
    - Like abstract classes, guarantees classes have certain methods
- More flexibility that abstract classes
    - Classes can implement multiple interfaces
        - You cannot directly extend multiple abstract classes
- New features in Java 8 interfaces
    - Interfaces can have static methods
        - Example shown on upcoming slides in this section
    - Interfaces can have concrete (default) methods
        - Example and more details in later section on Java 8 interfaces
- Restriction
    - Even in Java 8, interfaces cannot have mutable (modifiable) instance variables

---

### Concrete (Default) Methods

- Java 8 interfaces can have real methods
    - Not just method specifications
    - Interfaces still cannot have instance variables
    - Label the concrete methods with “default”
- Example

```
public interface SomeInterface {
    String method1(); // Method specification
    default String method2() { // Real (concrete) method
        // Normal code, perhaps calling method1
    }
    ...
}
```

---

### Attempt 4 (Best)

-  Make an interface called Shape
    - Define the specification for a getArea method
- Have all shapes implement this interface
    - Circle, Rectangle, and Square directly or indirectly implement Shape
        - Each provide a definition of getArea
- Make Shape[] containing mixed instances
    - Pass this to Shape.sumAreas
- In sumAreas, define parameter as Shape[]
    - Then loop down, call getArea on each, add up result
    - Move the sumAreas method to the Shape interface
        - Java enforces that you call it via Shape.sumAreas, never just by sumAreas.

---

### Attempt 4: Main Interface

```
public interface Shape {
    double getArea(); // Method specification
}
```

---

### Attempt 4: Shapes

- Circle

```
public class Circle implements Shape {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Rectangle

```
public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

- Square

```
public class Square extends Rectangle {
    ...
    public double getArea() { ... }
}
```

---

### Attempt 4: Static Method

```
public static double sumAreas(Shape[] shapes) {
    double sum = 0;
    for(Shape s: shapes) {
        sum = sum + s.getArea();
    }
    return(sum);
}
```

Where should I put this method?
I could put this static method in ShapeUtils as in the previous examples. But, since Java 8
interfaces allow static methods, a more natural place is in the Shape interface itself!

---

### Attempt 4: Final Interface

```
public interface Shape {
    double getArea(); // Method specification
    static double sumAreas(Shape[] shapes) { // Static method
        double sum = 0;
        
        for(Shape s: shapes) {
            sum = sum + s.getArea();
        }
        return(sum);
    }
}
```

Unlike with classes, the default visibility of methods in interfaces is public, so there is a tiny change to the static method shown on the previous slide: the omission of the “public” declaration.

---

### Attempt 4: Testing Code

```
public class ShapeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] shapes = { new Circle(10),
                            new Rectangle(5, 10),
                            new Square(10) };
        System.out.println("Sum of areas: " + Shape.sumAreas(shapes));
    }
}
```
