# Part 3 Object Oriented Programming in Java : Basics

- Basic
- Instance Variable
- Methods
- Constructors

---

## BASIC

- "Class" means a category of things
- "Object" means a particular item that belongs to a class, also called an "instance"
- Example
	- String s1 = "Hello";
	- Here, String is the class, and the variable s1 and the value "Hello" are objects (or "instances of the String class") 

---

## Instance Variables

- Definition
	- Data that is stored inside an object. 
	- can also be called "data members" or "fields".
- Syntax

```
public class MyClass {
    public SomeType field1, field2;
}
```

- Note
	- In any class that also has methods, it is almost always better to declare instance variables private instead of public.

---

- Persistent
	- Instance variables let an object have values that persist over time

```
Person p = new Person();
p.firstName = "Jane";
doSomethingElse();
checkValueOf(p.firstName); // Still "Jane"
```

- Object-oriented programming Characteristics : 
	- State, what the objects have (fields) -> instance variable.
	- Behavior, what the objects do.
	- Identity, what makes them unique.

---

### Major Points

- Java naming conventions
- Format of class definitions
- creating classes with "new"
- Accessing fields with "variableName.fieldName" 

---

### Java Naming Conventions

- Start classes with uppercase letters
- Start other things with lower case letters

```
public class MyClass {
    
    public String firstName, lastName; 
    
    public String fullName() {
        String name = firstName + " " + lastName;
        return name;
     }
}
```

---

### Objects and references

- Once a class is defined, object reference can be created
- Object references are initially null
- The new operator is required to explicitly create the object referenced
- Use dot between variableName and fieldName

### Example (Ship.java)

```
package ship;

public class Ship {
    public double x, y, speed, direction;
    public String name;
}
```

---

### Example (ShipTest.java)

```
package ship;

public class ShipTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Ship s1 = new Ship();
        s1.x = 0.0;
        s1.y = 0.0;
        s1.speed = 1.0;
        s1.direction = 0.0; // East
        s1.name = "Ship1";
        s1.x = s1.x + s1.speed
        * Math.cos(s1.direction * Math.PI / 180.0);
        s1.y = s1.y + s1.speed
        * Math.sin(s1.direction * Math.PI / 180.0);
        System.out.println(s1.name + " is at ("
        + s1.x + "," + s1.y + ").");
    }
}
```

## Compiling and Running
 
- Command Prompt
    - javac ship\Ship.java
    - java Ship.java
- IDE (Eclipse)
    - right click on the file 

---

## Methods

- Definition
    - Functions that are defined inside a class.
- Syntax
 
 ```
 public class MyClass() {
    public ReturnTypeClass myMethod(...) { ... }
 }
 ```

- Note
    - rule of thumb is to make method private unless it is needed to be public or others

---

- Behaviour
    - Methods let an object calculate values or do operations, based on its variable

## POM Structure

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
         http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">

    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.mitrais.training</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-training</artifactId>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <version>1.0</version>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
            <version>5.1.31</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.12</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

## GroupId
- A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project. While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections), it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
- groupId will identify your project uniquely across all projects, so we need to enforce a naming schema. It has to follow the package name rules, what means that has to be at least as a domain name you control, and you can create as many subgroups as you want.

---

## ArtifactId
- An artifact is something that is either produced or used by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project include: JARs, source and binary distributions, WARs. Each artifact is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is unique within a group
- artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed. eg. maven, commons-math

---

## Packaging
- Packaging in maven defines the artifact that will be produced by maven and the "maven package" goal is the one that will compile the code, gather the resources, run the unit tests and build a deployable artefact (JAR, WAR, EAR, etc.)
- The products of Maven are always written to the "target" directory.

---

## Dependencies
- Most every project depends upon others to build and run correctly
- Maven lists all the dependencies of every project and its transitive dependencies, allowing your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.

---

## Dependency Scope
- This element refers to the classpath of the task at hand (compiling and runtime, testing, etc.) as well as how to limit the transitivity of a dependency. There are five scopes available:
    - compile
    - provided
    - runtime
    - test
    - system

---

## Archetype
- Maven project templating toolkit
- syntax "mvn archetype:generate"
- Maven Quickstart archetype
    - mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=5-SNAPSHOT

---

## Maven Phase
- General build tasks
    - mvn clean
    - mvn validate
    - mvn compile
    - mvn test
    - mvn package
    - mvn verify
    - mvn install
    - mvn deploy
- Optionally, specify multiple build tasks
    - mvn clean install
