# Part 4 Object-Oriented Programming in Java: More Capabilities

- Overloading
- Best practices for “real” classes
    - Encapsulation and accessor methods
    - JavaDoc
- Inheritance
- Packages
- The toString method
- More iterations of the Person class

---

## BASIC

- "Class" means a category of things
- "Object" means a particular item that belongs to a class, also called an "instance"
- Example
	- String s1 = "Hello";
	- Here, String is the class, and the variable s1 and the value "Hello" are objects (or "instances of the String class") 

---

## Instance Variables

- Definition
	- Data that is stored inside an object. 
	- can also be called "data members" or "fields".
- Syntax

```
public class MyClass {
    public SomeType field1, field2;
}
```

- Note
	- In any class that also has methods, it is almost always better to declare instance variables private instead of public.

---

- Persistent
	- Instance variables let an object have values that persist over time

```
Person p = new Person();
p.firstName = "Jane";
doSomethingElse();
checkValueOf(p.firstName); // Still "Jane"
```

- Object-oriented programming Characteristics : 
	- State, what the objects have (fields) -> instance variable.
	- Behavior, what the objects do.
	- Identity, what makes them unique.

### Example (Ship.java)

```
package ship;

public class Ship {
    public double x, y, speed, direction;
    public String name;
}
```

---

### Example (ShipTest.java)

```
package ship;

public class ShipTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Ship s1 = new Ship();
        s1.x = 0.0;
        s1.y = 0.0;
        s1.speed = 1.0;
        s1.direction = 0.0; // East
        s1.name = "Ship1";
        s1.x = s1.x + s1.speed
        * Math.cos(s1.direction * Math.PI / 180.0);
        s1.y = s1.y + s1.speed
        * Math.sin(s1.direction * Math.PI / 180.0);
        System.out.println(s1.name + " is at ("
        + s1.x + "," + s1.y + ").");
    }
}
```

---

### Major Points

- Java naming conventions
- Format of class definitions
- creating classes with "new"
- Accessing fields with "variableName.fieldName" 

---

### Java Naming Conventions

- Start classes with uppercase letters
- Start other things with lower case letters

```
public class MyClass {
    
    public String firstName, lastName; 
    
    public String fullName() {
        String name = firstName + " " + lastName;
        return name;
     }
}
```

---

### Objects and references

- Once a class is defined, object reference can be created
- Object references are initially null
- The new operator is required to explicitly create the object referenced
- Use dot between variableName and fieldName 
		
---

## Compiling and Running
 
- Command Prompt
    - javac ship\Ship.java
    - java Ship.java
- IDE (Eclipse)
    - right click on the file > Run As > Java Application

---

## Methods

- Definition
    - Functions that are defined inside a class.
- Syntax
 
 ```
 public class MyClass() {
    public ReturnTypeClass myMethod(...) { ... }
 }
 ```

---

- Behaviour
    - Methods let an object calculate values or do operations, based on its variable

```
public class Person {
    public String firstName, lastName;

    public String getFullName() {
        return(firstName + " " + lastName);
    }
}
```

---

### Example (Ship2)

```java
package ship2;

public class Ship {
    public double x=0.0, y=0.0, speed=1.0, direction=0.0;
    public String name = "UnnamedShip";

    private double degreesToRadians(double degrees) {
        return(degrees * Math.PI / 180.0);
    }
    public void move() {
        double angle = degreesToRadians(direction);
        x = x + speed * Math.cos(angle);
        y = y + speed * Math.sin(angle);
    }
    public void printLocation() {
        System.out.println(name + " is at (" + x + "," + y + ").");
    }
}
```

---

### Example (Ship2Test)

```java
package ship2;

public class ShipTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Ship s1 = new Ship();
        s1.name = "Ship1";
        Ship s2 = new Ship();
        s2.direction = 135.0; // Northwest
        s2.speed = 2.0;
        s2.name = "Ship2";
        s1.move();
        s2.move();
        s1.printLocation();
        s2.printLocation();
    }
}
```

---

### Major Points

- Format of method definitions (void vs returnType)
- Methods that access local fields
- Calling methods (from internal - external class)
- Calling static methods
- Default values for fields
- public/private distinction

---

## Method Visibility
- public/private distinction
   - A declaration of private means that “outside” methods can’t call it – only methods within the same class can
- Only say public for methods that you want to guarantee your class will make available to users
- You are free to change or eliminate private methods without telling users of your class

---

## Static Methods

- Also called “class methods” (vs. “instance methods”)
    - Static functions do not access any non-static methods or fields within their class and are almost like global functions in other languages
- Call a static method through the class name
    - ClassName.functionName(arguments);
- Example: Math.cos
    - The Math class has a static method called cos that expects a double precision number as an argument. So, you can call Math.cos(3.5) without ever having any object (instance) of the Math class double cosine = Math.cos(someAngle);
- Note on the main method
    - Since the system calls main without first creating an object, static methods are the only type of methods that main can call directly (i.e. without building an object and calling the method of that object)

---

## Constructors

- Definition
    - Code that gets executed when “new” is called
- Syntax
    - “Method” that exactly matches the class name and has no return type (not even void).

```
public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(...) { ... }
}
```

---

- Shorter code
    - Lets you build an instance of the class, and assign values to instance variables, all in one line
    - Vs. one line to build instance, then several additional lines to assign instance variables
- Consistency
- Lets you enforce that all instances have certain properties
    - For example, a Ship might not be legal without a name, but with instance variables, there is no way to force the programmer to assign a name
- Side effects
    - Constructors let you run extra code when class is instantiated. You can draw the Ship on the GUI, add the Ship to the fleet, keep a count of all Ships, etc.

---

### Default & User Defined Constructor

- Default Constructor
    - Java provided when creating class
- User Defined Constructor
    - user can create its own constructor

```
public class MyClass {
    public String a;
    public int b;

    public MyClass(String a, int b) {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
    }
}
```

---

### Major Points

- Format of constructor definitions
- The “this” reference
    - The this object reference can be used inside any non-static method to refer to the current object
    - The common uses of the “this” reference are:
        - To pass pointer to the current object to another method
            someMethod(this);
        - To resolve name conflicts :

```
    public class Blah {
    private int x;
    public Blah(int x) { this.x = x; }
    }
```

        It is only necessary to say this.fieldName when you have a local variable and a field with the same name;
        otherwise just use fieldName with no “this”
