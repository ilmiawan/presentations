# Part 4 Object-Oriented Programming in Java: More Capabilities

- Overloading
- Best practices for “real” classes
    - Encapsulation and accessor methods
    - JavaDoc
- Inheritance
- Packages
- The toString method
- More iterations of the Person class

---

## Overloading

- Idea
    - Classes can have more than one method with the same name, or more than one constructor
    - The methods or constructors have to differ from each other by having different number or types of arguments
- Syntax example

```
public class MyClass {
    public double randomNum() { … }; // Range 1-10
    public double randomNum(double range) { … }
} 
```

---

- Overloading methods
    – Lets you have similar names for similar operations
        - MathUtils.arraySum(arrayOfInts)
        - MathUtils.arraySum(arrayOfDoubles)
        - MathUtils.log(number) // Assumes loge(number)
        - MathUtils.log(number, base) // logbase(number)
- Overloading constructors
    – Lets you build instances in different ways
        - new Ship(someName) // Default x, y, speed, direction
        - new Ship(someX, someY, someSpeed, someDirection, someName)
        
---

## Example (Ship4)

```
package ship4;

public class Ship {
    public double x=0.0, y=0.0, speed=1.0, direction=0.0;
    public String name;
    public Ship(double x, double y,
                double speed, double direction, 
                String name) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.direction = direction;
        this.name = name;
    }
    public Ship(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    ...
```

---

### Example (Ship4.java)

```
...
    public void move() {
        move(1);
    }
    public void move(int steps) {
        double angle = degreesToRadians(direction);
        x = x + steps * speed * Math.cos(angle);
        y = y + steps * speed * Math.sin(angle);
    }
    // degreesToRadians and printLocation as before
}
```

---

### Example (Ship4Test.java)

```
package ship4;
public class ShipTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Ship s1 = new Ship("Ship1");
        Ship s2 = new Ship(0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 135.0, "Ship2");
        s1.move();
        s2.move(3);
        s1.printLocation();
        s2.printLocation();
    }
}
```

---

## OOP Design : Best Practices

- Ideas
    - Instance variables should always be private
        - And hooked to outside world with getBlah and/or setBlah
    - From very beginning, put in JavaDoc-style comments
- Syntax example

```
/** Short summary. More detail. Can use HTML. */
public class MyClass {
    private String firstName;
    public String getFirstName() { return(firstName); }
    public void setFirstName(String s) { firstName = s; }
}
```

---

- Supports secondary goal of OOP
    - Limits ripple effect, where changes to one class requires changes to the classes that use it, that require changes to the classes that use that, and so forth
        - Lets you make changes to internal representation of classes without changing its public interface
        - Makes code more maintainable

---

## OOP Principles

- Basic OOP principles
    - Primary goal: avoid needing to repeat identical or almost-identical code
        - DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself
        - Code reuse
    - Secondary goal: limit ripple effect
        - Where changes to one piece of code requires changes to the pieces that use it
- Advanced OOP principles
    - SOLID

## Example (Ship5)

```
/** Ship example to demonstrate OOP in Java. */
public class Ship {
    private double x=0.0, y=0.0, speed=1.0, direction=0.0;
    private String name;
    …
    /** Get current X location. */
    public double getX() {
        return(x);
    }
    /** Set current X location. */
    public void setX(double x) {
        this.x = x;
    } …
```

---

## Example (Ship5Test)

```
package ship5;

/** Small example to test the Ship class.
* <p>
* From <a href="http://www.coreservlets.com/">the
* coreservlets.com Java tutorials</a>.
*/
public class ShipTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Ship s1 = new Ship("Ship1");
        Ship s2 = new Ship(0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 135.0, "Ship2");
        s1.move();
        s2.move(3);
        s1.printLocation();
        s2.printLocation();
    }
}
```

## Compiling and Running
 
- Command Prompt
    - javac Ship5java
    - java Ship5.java
    - javadoc *.java
- IDE (Eclipse)
    - right click on the file > Run As > Java Application
    - Select project, go to Project menu and choose “Generate Javadoc”
      - If it asks you where javadoc.exe is located, you can find it in the bin folder of your Java installation (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_75\bin)

---

## Major Points

- Encapsulation
    - Lets you change internal representation and data structures without users of your class changing their code
    - Lets you put constraints on values without users of your class changing their code
    - Lets you perform arbitrary side effects without users of your class changing their code
- Comments and JavaDoc
    - Comments marked with /** ... */ will be part of the online documentation
        - These should go before every public class, every public method, and every public constructor
    - To build online documentation within Eclipse, do Project  Generate Javadoc
    - To build the documentation from command line, use “javadoc *.java”

---

## More Details on getters and setters

- Eclipse will automatically build getters/setters from instance variables
    - R-click anywhere in code
    - Choose Source  Generate Getters and Setters
    - However, if you later click on instance variable and do Refactor  Rename, Eclipse will not automatically rename the accessor methods

---

- There need not be both getters and setters
    - It is common to have fields that can be set at instantiation, but never changed again (immutable field). It is even quite common to have classes containing only immutable fields (immutable classes) 

```
public class Ship {
    private final String shipName;
    public Ship(...) { shipName = ...; ... }
    public String getName() { return(shipName); }
    // No setName method
}
```

---

- Getter/setter names need not correspond to instance var names
    - Common to do so if there is a simple correspondence, but this is not required
        - Notice on previous page that instance variable was “shipName”, but methods were “getName” and “setName”
    - In fact, there doesn’t even have to be a corresponding instance variable

```
public class Customer {
    ...
    public String getFirstName() { getFromDatabase(…); }
    public void setFirstName(…) { storeInDatabase(…); }
    public double getBonus() { return(Math.random()); }
}
```

---

## Inheritance

- Ideas
    - You can make a class that “inherits” characteristics of another class
        - The original class is called “parent class”, “super class”, or “base class”
        - The new class is called “child class”, “subclass”, or “extended class”
    - The child class has access to all non-private methods of the parent class
        - No special syntax need to call inherited methods
- Syntax example
        
```
public class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    ...
}
```

---

- Supports primary goal of OOP
    - Supports the key OOP principle of code reuse
        - I.e., don’t write identical or nearly-identical code twice
    - You can design class hierarchies so that shared behavior is inherited by all classes that need it

---

## Simple Example

- Person

```
public class Person {
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
    public String getLastName() { ... }
}
```

- Employee

```
public class Employee extends Person {
    public double getSalary() { ... }
   
    public String getEmployeeInfo() {
        return(getFirstName() + " " + getLastName() + " earns " + getSalary());
    }
}
```

---

## Example (Speedboat)

```
public class Speedboat extends Ship {
    private String color = "red";
    
    public Speedboat(String name) {
        super(name);
        setSpeed(20);
    }
    
    public Speedboat(double x, double y, double speed, double direction,
                     String name, String color) {
        super(x, y, speed, direction, name);
        setColor(color);
    }
    
    @Override // Optional but useful -- discussed later
    public void printLocation() {
        System.out.print(getColor().toUpperCase() + " ");
        super.printLocation();
    }
    ..
}
```

---

## Example (SpeedboatTest)

```
public class SpeedboatTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Speedboat s1 = new Speedboat("Speedboat1");
        Speedboat s2 = new Speedboat(0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 135.0,
        "Speedboat2", "blue");
        Ship s3 = new Ship(0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 135.0, "Ship1");
        s1.move();
        s2.move();
        s3.move();
        s1.printLocation();
        s2.printLocation();
        s3.printLocation();
    }
}
```

---

## Major Points

- Format for defining subclasses
    - And nomenclature (parent/child, super/sub, base/extended)
- Using inherited methods
    - No special syntax required
- Using super(…) for inherited constructors
    - Only when the zero-arg constructor is not OK
        - The most common case is to omit super and use zero-arg constructor of parent, but super is used moderately often
- Using super.someMethod(…) for inherited methods
    - Only when there is a name conflict
        - Used rarely

---

## Review of packages

- Idea
    - Organize classes in groups.
- Syntax
    - Make folder called somepackage
        - In Eclipse, R-click on “src” and do New  Package
    - Put “package somepackage” at top of file
        - Automatic in Eclipse
    - To use code from another package
        - put “import somepackage.*” below your package statement

---

- Avoiding name conflicts
    - Team members can work on different parts of project without worrying about what class names other teams use.
- to run from command line use the fully-qualified name, i.e., including package
    - java packageName.Classname

---

## The toString Method

- Idea
    – If you give a class a toString method, that method is automatically called whenever
        - An object of that class is converted to a String
        - An object of that class is printed
- Example

```
public class Person {
    // Main code covered earlier
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return("PERSON: " + getFullName());
    }
}
```

---

### overview of @

- Oddities of toString
    - We write the method, but we never call it
    - If we spell method wrong, we don’t know until run time
        - @Override useful for both issues; more details later
- What will be printed on final line below?

```
public class Person {
    ...
    public void tostring() { 
        return(getFullName()); 
    }
}

...
Person p = new Person(...);
System.out.println(p);
```

## Summary

- Overloading
    - You can have multiple methods or constructors with the same name. They must differ in argument signatures
- Best practices
    - Make all instance variables private. Hook them to the outside with getBlah and/or setBlah
    - Use JavaDoc-style comments from the very beginning
- Inheritance
    - public class Subclass extends Superclass { … }
        - Non-private methods available with no special syntax
- Organization
    - Put all code in packages
    - Make output more readable by implementing toString
