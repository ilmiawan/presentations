# Part 2 Tools Setup

- Maven
- Git
- Unit Test

---

## 2.1 Maven

- Is a Java build tool (project, dependency management)
- Used for Java projects
- Adopt convention over configuration
- Under Apache Software Foundation (mostly supported by SonaType)

## Java builds

Build Tools Advantages

- Portability
- Automation
- Repeatability

![alt text](../gradle/images/java-build.svg "Typical Java build process")

---

## Mindset

- All build systems are essentially the same:
  - Compile Source code
  - Copy Resource
  - Compile and Run Tests
  - Package Project
  - Deploy Project
  - Cleanup
- Describe the project and configure the build
  - You donâ€™t script a build
  - Maven has no concept of a condition
  - Plugins are configured

---

## How does it works?

- Build configured using pom.xml file
- POM = Project Object Model
- Uses standard build order, project layout
- Identifies dependencies in the pom.xml file
- POM can call child POM's

## Setup & Install

- Download [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Extract to local directory e.g. `C:\maven` or `/opt/maven`
- Create or modify `PATH` environment variable to include maven executable e.g. `c:\maven\bin`
- Test maven with command `mvn -v`

```

## POM Structure

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
         http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">

    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <artifactId>java-training</artifactId>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <version>1.0</version>

    </dependencies>
</project>
```

---

## GroupId
- A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project. use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
- groupId will identify your project uniquely across all projects, so we need to enforce a naming schema. It has to follow the package name rules.

---

## ArtifactId
- An artifact is something that is either produced or used by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project include: JARs, source and binary distributions, WARs. Each artifact is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is unique within a group
- artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed. eg. maven, commons-math

---

## Packaging
- Packaging in maven defines the artifact that will be produced by maven and the "maven package" goal is the one that will compile the code, gather the resources, run the unit tests and build a deployable artefact (JAR, WAR, EAR, etc.)
- The products of Maven are always written to the "target" directory.

---

## Dependencies
- Most every project depends upon others to build and run correctly
- Maven lists all the dependencies of every project and its transitive dependencies, allowing your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.

---

## Dependency Scope
- This element refers to the classpath of the task at hand (compiling and runtime, testing, etc.) as well as how to limit the transitivity of a dependency. There are five scopes available:
    - compile
    - provided
    - runtime
    - test
    - system

---

## Archetype
- Maven project templating toolkit
- syntax "mvn archetype:generate"
- Maven Quickstart archetype
    - mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=5-SNAPSHOT

---

## Maven Phase
- General build tasks
    - mvn clean
    - mvn validate
    - mvn compile
    - mvn test
    - mvn package
    - mvn verify
    - mvn install
    - mvn deploy
- Optionally, specify multiple build tasks
    - mvn clean install

Phase Process

## Git

- Version control system (VCS) created for a single task: managing changes to your files.
- Track every change a software project goes through, as well as where those changes came from.
- Git had several unique constraints, including:
    - Reliability
    - Efficient management of large projects
    - Support for distributed development (Software development model in which IT teams spread across geographical lines collaborate on applications or various software)
    - Support for non-linear development


---

## Setup and install

- Download [https://git-scm.com/]
- Run installer and use its default settings
- Check git installation :
    - go to project dedicated folder
    - Right click > Git Bash Here
    - on git bash windows, type : git --version

---

## Github

- A remote git repository
- free for public account usage
- able to fork from other repo
- pull request

---

## Git commands

- Initialize the Git Repository
    - git init
- View the repository status
    - git status
- Stage a Snapshot
    - git add 'filename'
        - ex. "git add fileName.txt"
- Commit a Snapshot
    - git commit

---

## Git remote

- Clone project from repository
    - git clone remote-repo-path
        - ex. "git clone https://github.com/mitraisjavameetup/java-programming-exercises"
- Checkout a repo branch
    - git checkout branch-name
        - ex. "git checkout develop"
- Synchronize local project with remote repository
    - git pull origin branch_name
        - ex. "git pull origin master"

---

- Push local changes to remote repository
    - git push origin branch_name
        - ex. "git push origin master"
- Create new branch and checkout automatically
    - git checkout -b new_branch_name
- Push branch to remote repository
    - git push origin new_branch_name

---

## Exercise

- create github account on [github.com]
- fork from repository : https://github.com/mitraisjavameetup/java-programming-exercises
- clone to local folder

---

## UNIT TEST

- Software testing method for quality assurance
- Automated tests
- Initiate TDD development


---

## JUnit

- unit testing java framework
- syntax :

```
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestJunit {

   @Test
   public void testAdd() {
      String str = "Junit is working fine";
      assertEquals("Junit is working fine",str);
   }

}
```

---

- @Test is test method annotation to run and check
- assert is for asserting the process done by method tested
- running java testing in command prompt is the same as running java class
- on the IDE it is faster to run unit testing, by right clicking and Run As > unit test
